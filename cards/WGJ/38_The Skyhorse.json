Now you can play it as a 1 mana 2/2 with flying but that seems undesirable so I don't think people will. The scale is better making it a 3 mana 3/3, 4 mana 4/4, and 5 mana 5/5 etc. Added lifelink to ensure it's better than wreckyard crane. Possibly too much juice though maybe first strike is better.", "image_type": "png"}
