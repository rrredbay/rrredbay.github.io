I submitted a Shrine after another person submit a Shrine recently and got a Totem. WTF is Totem? The name on this card is amazing but its not a Shrine. In the popcorn thread so many peeple seemed to love designing cycles but this card just kill the potental for a shrine cycle. The card feels like silly group hug card for EDH, maye some blue aggro deck boards it in against contorl, whatever it is not a Shrine. Rant over just needed to get this off my chest and move on. Probably fine to keep just annoyed a lot.", "image_type": "png"}
