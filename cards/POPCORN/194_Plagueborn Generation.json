If we cut invoke, it's probably fine though!\n\nI think Urgesh/Plagueborn create a Splinter Twin situation with the Avatars, where Plagueborn is more specifically that combo feel than Urgesh. I like two card combos and this one being gated by some strong color intensity felt okay.\n\nThat being said, I think it's right to identify both of these cards as potentially problematic. If we feel that Plagueborn is too strong with the GB Avatar then I'm cool with cutting it.", "image_type": "png"}
